Oregon workers' compensation paid indemnity data. The data is presented in the Department of Consumer and Business Services report at https://www.oregon.gov/dcbs/reports/compensation/Pages/index.aspx. The attached pdf provides definitions of the data.

Workersâ€™ compensation pays PPD benefits for the permanent loss of use or function of any portion of the body resulting from a compensable injury. PPD benefits are based on the benefits in statute at the time of injury, not the date of the award. These PPD data are reported by the year of the last claim closure. The average awards include the initial awards made by insurers and the net amounts awarded during the appeal process. Data will change as claims are opened and closed over time. 

The structure of PPD benefits underwent a major change in 2005. Prior to 2005, the benefits were based on statutory lists of scheduled and unscheduled body parts. For claims with injuries since 1/1/2005, the permanent impairment of all body parts and systems is rated in relation to the whole person. The benefit is based on the statewide average weekly wage multiplied by the percentage of impairment. Workers who have not been released to regular work are also entitled to a work disability award in addition to their impairment award.
