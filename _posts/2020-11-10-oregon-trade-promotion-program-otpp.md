Grants provided in Fiscal Year 2020. The Oregon Trade Promotion Program offers matching grants to small businesses to begin exporting goods into global markets, or expand sales in new markets. They can be used towards trade show costs, trade mission participation, translation services, export workshops and other eligible activities that support export growth.
