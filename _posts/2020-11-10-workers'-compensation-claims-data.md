Oregon workers' compensation claims counts. Where available, the data is provided since 1968, the year Oregon's modern workers' compensation system began. The data is presented in the Department of Consumer and Business Services report at https://www.oregon.gov/dcbs/reports/compensation/Pages/index.aspx. The attached pdf provides definitions of the data.
