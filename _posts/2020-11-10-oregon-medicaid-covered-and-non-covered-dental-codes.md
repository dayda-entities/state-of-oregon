"Not covered" codes are not part of the OHP Plus benefit package, or are for services that are incidental to another service and not reimbursed separately. Where applicable, please refer to Prioritized List placement, Guideline Notes and OARs listed for each code for complete information regarding benefit coverage and limitations.

For services billed as medical, use the CMS-1500 claim format, CPT/HCPCS codes and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. (This list may not note every dental code that has a corresponding medical code.)

To find fee-for-service reimbursement rates, view the OHP Fee-for-Service Fee Schedule at http://www.oregon.gov/oha/hsd/ohp/pages/fee-schedule.aspx. This schedule represents a given point in time and may not include payable codes that were added to MMIS after the posted fee schedule date.
