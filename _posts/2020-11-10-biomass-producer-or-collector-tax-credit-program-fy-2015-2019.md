The Oregon Department of Energy issued tax credits under the Biomass Producer or Collector Tax Credit program for the production and collection of biomass material — such as wood, methane, or manure — that was sourced in Oregon and used as biofuel. 
The program ended (sunset) at the end of the 2017 tax year, which was dependent on the applicants’ tax year. This report covers July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2019 and includes the final set of tax credits issued under the program.
