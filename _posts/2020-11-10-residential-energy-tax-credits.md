The Oregon Department of Energy issued residential energy tax credits to Oregonians between 1977 and 2017. Incentives were available for ductless heat pumps, furnaces, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, solar energy systems, and other energy efficiency devices. The RETC program ended (sunset) on December 31, 2017, and final applications were due June 1, 2018. For more information visit https://www.oregon.gov/transparency/Pages/index.aspx.
