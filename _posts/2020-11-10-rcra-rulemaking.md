The proposed rules will adopt federal rules into Oregonâ€™s rules. The amendments will incorporate amended versions of previously adopted federal rules, and will also incorporate some federal rules for the first time. The purpose of these amendments is to align Oregon rules with federal rules and to enable Oregon to retain delegated federal authority to operate its Resource and Recovery Act hazardous waste program.
