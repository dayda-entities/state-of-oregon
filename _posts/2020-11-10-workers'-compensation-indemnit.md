Oregon workers' compensation indemnity data. The data is presented in the Department of Consumer and Business Services report at https://www.oregon.gov/dcbs/reports/compensation/Pages/index.aspx. The attached pdf provides definitions of the data.

Claim resolutions: Most accepted disabling workers' compensation claims go through the claim closure process in which the insurer stops temporary disability payments and determines PPD. Accepted disabling claims may be resolved multiple times. Other claims are settled with claim disposition agreements (CDAs). In this table, claim closures and CDA settlements are called claim resolutions.

Average temporary disability days paid for claim resolutions: The figures are the average days of paid temporary disability, both temporary total disability and temporary partial disability, for the yearsâ€™ resolutions. Missing data are estimated. Insurers do not report days for CDA resolutions; these are estimated.

Resolved claims In this set of data, claims with multiple closures are counted once. If a claim is reopened and reclosed, it is counted by the year of the latest resolution. Therefore, historical data will change.

For temporary disability, the days and average dollars include both temporary total disability and temporary partial disability. Missing data are estimated. Insurers do not report days for CDA resolutions; these are estimated.
