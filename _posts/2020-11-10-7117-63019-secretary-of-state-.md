Converted to Workday Position Numbers - In January 2019 the State of Oregon implemented a new HR System that changed all the position numbers.  This report shows the new position numbers as though Workday was in place at the beginning of the biennium.

This includes all Secretary of State payroll expenditures for the 2017-2019 budget.
