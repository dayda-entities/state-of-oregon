This theme delineates Urban Growth Boundaries (UGBs) in the state of Oregon. Oregon land use laws limit development outside of urban growth boundaries. The line work was created by various sources including the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD), the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), Metro Regional Council of Governments (Metro), county and city GIS departments, and the Oregon Department of Administrative Services - Geospatial Enterprise Office (DAS-GEO).Urban growth boundaries (UGBs) are lines drawn on planning and zoning maps to show where a city expects to experience growth for the next 20 years. UGBs were established under Oregon Statewide Planning Goals in 1973 by the Oregon State Legislature (Senate Bill 100).
