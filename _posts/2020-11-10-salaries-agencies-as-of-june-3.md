Each annual salary listed in this report is 12 times that particular employee's monthly adjusted salary rate as of June 30, 2010 (between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010). "Annual Salary" includes most differential payments (such as work-out-of-classification and bilingual differential), but excludes payments for overtime, shift differential, benefits, and vacation payout. The report does not account for unpaid furlough leave that management employees began taking in fiscal year 2009-2010; neither does it reflect step decreases and unpaid furlough leave that some classified employees began taking after June 2009.

This report does not include annual salaries for employees of the Oregon University System, semi-independent agencies, temporary employees, or records protected by court order.
