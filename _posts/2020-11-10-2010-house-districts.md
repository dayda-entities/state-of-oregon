This geographic feature data is a product of the 76th Oregon Legislative Session Redistricting process. These are the approved House districts. Every 10 years the Legislature is tasked with reassigning census units to new districts to balance the population. There are two House districts nested in one Senate district. Each Senate district is numbered by sequential House districts (Senate 1 consists of House 1 & 2).Verify district accuracy by checking with the Oregon Secretary of State's Office or Oregon Department of Administrative Services - Geospatial Enterprise Office before conducting any legally binding analysis.
