The IT Portfolio dataset contains data for all Information Technology (IT) related projects required to be oversighted or governed as part of the project oversight process (Stage Gate). The purpose of the project oversight process is to provide IT governance and oversight to agency technology projects to ensure consistent governance and management of technology initiatives within the State of Oregon.  

Questions about projects within this dataset should be directed to the Agency managing the project.
