DEQ and our partners the Oregon Health Authority are conducting a rulemaking to create new rules to regulate industrial air toxics and reduce the impact these pollutants have on the health of Oregonians.
 
The proposed Cleaner Air Oregon rules would set health risk limits on pollutants that industrial facilities emit so that neighbors and vulnerable people (such as children) are protected from potentially harmful levels of exposure.
