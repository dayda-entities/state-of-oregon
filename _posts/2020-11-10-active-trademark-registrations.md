List of trademark registrations that are active on the record of the Secretary of State Corporation Division as of the end of the previous month.
A trade or service mark identifies goods or services made or sold by a person to distinguishâ€‹ them from goods or services made or sold by others. It can consist of words, names, symbols, devices or any combination thereof. The mark must be in use before it can be registered. The registration is optional.
