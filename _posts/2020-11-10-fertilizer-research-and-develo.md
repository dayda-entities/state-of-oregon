The Oregon Department of Agriculture's fertilizer research and development program provides grant monies for field level projects that address the interactions of fertilizers, agricultural minerals, and agricultural amendments with ground or surface water. Since 1990, the program has provided over 1.9 million dollars for 90+ projects dealing with a wide variety of Oregon crops throughout the state. All funds distributed are generated through fertilizer, agricultural mineral, and agricultural amendments product sales.
