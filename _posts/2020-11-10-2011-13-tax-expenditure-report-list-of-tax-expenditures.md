The 1995 Budget Accountability Act (the Act) requires the governor, with the assistance of the Department of Revenue and the Department of Administrative Services, to produce a tax expenditure report every biennium, along with the Governor’s Recommended Budget. The report was first prepared in 1996 for the 1997–99 biennium. This report covers tax expenditures for the 2011–13 biennium.
