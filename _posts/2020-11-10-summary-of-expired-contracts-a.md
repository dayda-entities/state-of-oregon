The following data is provided as an extract from the Statewide Procurement System (Oregon Procurement Information Network - ORPIN). It is a complete list of contracts that expired on or before June 30, 2013 and represents the full extent of electronic records of expired contracts that are tracked within ORPIN. The contract values reflected in the report are estimates only. Note: A number of contracts may indicate an “Amendment Date” that may exceed the “Expiration Date”. In these instances, the “Amendment Date” reflects an automated system time/date stamp that the system appends to the contract when the electronic version was accessed or modified, not necessarily when the legal instrument (the contract itself) was modified. Note: This report may not include contract information for the Oregon Judicial Department, Oregon State Lottery, Oregon University System, Oregon State Treasurer, or semi-independent state agencies, boards, and commissions. Some executive branch agencies have independent contracting authority for specific goods and services (e.g., Transportation, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Human Services, Fish and Wildlife, Parks and Recreation, Aviation, Economic and Community Development, Housing, Corrections, Veterans Affairs, Military, Education, and state agencies "specifically authorized" by any law outside the Code to "enter into a contract"). Thus, the ORPIN system may not capture contract information about those activities.
