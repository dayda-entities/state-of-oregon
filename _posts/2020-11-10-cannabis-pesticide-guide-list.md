The intent of the list is to assist growers in distinguishing those pesticide products whose labels do not legally prohibit use on cannabis from those that clearly do not allow use. The list is not an endorsement or recommendation to use these products in the production of cannabis in Oregon. Do not hesitate to contact Pesticide staff with questions or for label clarification. 

***Alert regarding the use of pyrethrins and/or piperonyl butoxide***

Recent lab results show high levels of the active ingredients pyrethrins and/or piperonyl butoxide in some cannabis samples. Pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide are on ODA's Guide List for Pesticides and Cannabis. ODA is investigating why some samples indicate levels of one or both of these pesticides, which far exceed the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) Action Levels, and yet others do not. To retain the listing of these two pesticides on the Guidelist, ODA, OHA, and Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) need to learn more about what influences pesticide residue levels on cannabis. If you used pyrethrins and/or piperonyl butoxide, and your cannabis tested below OHAâ€™s Action level, please contact ODA at (503) 986-4553.
