Under ORS 468B.051, DEQ proposes rule amendments to increase water quality fees for 2019 by three percent above the 2018 fees. These fees apply to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits and Water Pollution Control Facility permits. 

DEQ needs the fee increase to help account for the anticipated increase in the cost of administering the permit program and to achieve its objectives. DEQâ€™s objectives are for a sustainable water quality permitting program that issues timely, high quality permits, and that ensures compliance with permit conditions through inspections, enforcement, and reporting to EPA.
