List of diagnosis codes that are exempt from the requirement listed in Oregon Administrative Rule 410-125-0450(1)(b)(D), which states, "DRG and percentage-paid hospitals must submit a POA indicator for the principal diagnosis and every secondary diagnosis code. A valid POA indicator must be included on all inpatient hospital claims. Claims without a valid POA indicator shall be denied."
