Oregon workers' compensation data. The data is presented in the Department of Consumer and Business Services report at https://www.oregon.gov/dcbs/reports/compensation/Pages/index.aspx. The attached pdf provides definitions of the data.

The Office of the Ombudsman for Injured Workers is an independent advocate for injured workers that assists workers by accepting, investigating, and attempting to resolve complaints concerning matters related to workers’ compensation. 

The Office of the Small Business Ombudsman for Workers’ Compensation was created during the 1990 special session to serve as an advocate for and educator of small businesses. The SBO is the resource center for employers needing information about the workers’ compensation system. 

Workers’ Compensation Division benefit consultants answer workers’ questions about their claims, describe workers’ rights and responsibilities, and help people understand the workers’ compensation system.
