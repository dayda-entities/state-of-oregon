With coordination and approval from the Governorâ€™s office, Business Oregon makes strategic loans and forgivable loans from the Strategic Reserve Fund. These targeted investments in Fiscal Years 2016-2020 are made to specific projects that create jobs, provide actionable research, or build regional capacity for future growth.
