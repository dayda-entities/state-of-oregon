Every effort has been made to ensure the data are complete, but these records reflect information reported to this agency by others. The Oregon Department of Energy is not responsible for data that is misinterpreted or altered in any way. If errors are discovered after publication of the records, the data are corrected in the electronic files.  It is estimated that there is a margin of error of less than one percent. NOTE: This data reports tax credits issued and may differ slightly from the tax credits allowed due to rounding. The tax-credit rate depends on the biomass material type. The energy value of the biomass materials in Million Btu (MMBtu) are estimates.
