Codes in this group are not on the Prioritized List.  They are not specific enough for OHP to determine coverage.  As such they are not eligible for reimbursement by OHP's FFS program. Providers are directed to bill with a more definitive diagnosis code. This list does not guarantee coverage.  For specific coverage information please contact the Provider Services Unit at  1-800-336-6016.
