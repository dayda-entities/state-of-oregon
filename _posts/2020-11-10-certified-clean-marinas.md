The Oregon Clean Marina program is a voluntary program working to protect and improve local water quality by promoting the usage of environmentally sensitive practices at marinas. The program provides the opportunity for marinas, boatyards, yacht clubs, and floating home moorages to receive recognition for helping to establish and promote a cleaner marine environment for Oregon.

If a facility is in compliance with existing environmental regulations and uses a high percentage of the recommended best management practices, it can be designated as an Oregon Clean Marina. Such certified marinas are authorized to fly the Clean Marina flag and use the logo in their advertising. The flag and logo are signals to boaters that a marina cares about the cleanliness of Oregon waterways.

The program also provides information to marine facility managers on how to eliminate or reduce the input of polluting materials – such as oil, paint, cleaning chemicals, sewage, fish waste, and trash – into the environment.
