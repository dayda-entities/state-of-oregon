This rulemaking is to adopt a permanent version of a previously-adopted temporary rule. DEQ recognized an unintended consequence in the wording of its pathogen reduction rule for solid waste. As formerly worded, the rule imposed different pathogen reduction requirements for anaerobic composters located on agricultural operations than for those located elsewhere. DEQ did not intend that result and has corrected that consequence in the rule wording proposed in this rulemaking.
